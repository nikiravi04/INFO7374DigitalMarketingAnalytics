# What is a video game streaming application? 

Who does not like video games? From the very famous mario series to Fortnite, video gaming has come a long way. Don't you remember fighting for a joystick with your siblings or friends when video games allowed only two players at a time ? 
Now with the boom in technology, the gaming industry has leveled up its standards by allowing 100’s to 1000 players at a time 
to not just play but also to interact and live stream their play time. 

For those unfamiliar with it, Twitch is a streaming video website where content creators attract wide audiences of viewers and 
subscribers by streaming themselves while they play popular video games or other entertaining content. 
In 2018 alone, over 1 million years of content was consumed on Twitch, with over 4 million unique monthly streamers providing it. 
As you can imagine, with so many choices of what to watch or what to play, 
the streamers are competing with each other for viewers and dedicated subscribers.
